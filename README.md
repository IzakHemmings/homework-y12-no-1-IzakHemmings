Objectives:

Objectives Part 1: (contact your teacher if you need support in completing this part)
- The user needs to be able to enter a string via the keyboard, following a meaningful prompt.

The program needs to output the following (in a meaningful format):
- The number of characters in the String.
- The number of 'special' characters in the string, as defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary).
- The number of capital letters in the String.

Objectives Part 2: (only attempt this part, once you have completed part 1)
- The user needs to be able to enter two strings.
- The program will need to check that each of the strings is only composed of lower english alphabetic letters. and are of the same length.
- The user needs to be presented with a suitable re-entry prompt, if the above condition is not met.
- The program needs to output a new string composed out of the letters from both strings, according to the following rule: pick a random letter from the first string and add it to the new string. Pick a number from the second string and add it to the new string. Repeat the two previous steps until all characters from the two given strings are used up.
